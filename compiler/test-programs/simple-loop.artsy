While Test!!!

Prints all numbers of x from -1 to 40 onto a new line
#/

# x < y and x < 30 or y > 30 or y < 10 and x < 100

while (x < y) {

	let x = x + 10;
	print x; # Print expression
	print "\t";
	print y + z; # Print expression
	addline;
	let x = x + 1; # Increase iterator variable
}

print x + x;
